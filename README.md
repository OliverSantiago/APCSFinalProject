	Our project is going to be a farming simulator, based on Stardew Valley. We want to have a grid based system which are plots of land that can be interacted with. Each plot is going to be an object that, if interacted with another object, can change. For example, “using” the hoe object next to the plot will make the plot tilled. The purpose of the game is to interact with these plots to grow crops, and sell them to make money.
